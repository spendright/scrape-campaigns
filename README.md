Scrapers for Consumer Campaigns
===============================

These are [SpendRight](http://spendright.org)'s scrapers for various consumer campaigns.

These produce raw data which is then cleaned up and merged by [msd](https://github.com/spendright/msd). If you'd like to download the cleaned-up version of this data, learn more about its format, or learn how to write scrapers of your own, check out [msd's morph.io page](https://morph.io/spendright/msd).
